INSTALL

Use cmake >=2.8 to configure and install gubbins on your machine. 

It is general practice to use an "out of source" build.

Here's one way to get gubbins working (on UNIX or GNU/Linux) starting
from your gubbins directory:

$mkdir build
$cd build
$cmake ..
$make

The gubbins library is placed in /path_to_gubbins/lib.

To test gubbins, or to see what he can do, see the examples
directory. Compiling an example is the same as compiling the library
(except that we do not care about out of source builds).

Here's one way to compile step-0:

$cd examples/step-0
$cmake .
$make

The example "step-0" is built and linked against gubbins.
